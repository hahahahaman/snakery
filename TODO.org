* DONE collision with self
* DONE undo system
how would i do this?

i have a dynamic 3d array. each time a move occurs i reset the state

too memory intensive

---

just keep track of the tail position and the fruits eaten
* TODO fruit that makes you shrink one?
yeah that's a good simple extension
* TODO switch head position with other body parts?
makes the game much more flexible
* TODO portals?
* DONE make levels
** DONE changing level logic
** DONE reading maps
*** DONE map array format
*** DONE walls
*** DONE head start position
*** DONE body start positions
* DONE start screen
* TODO death screen? not super necessary
tell player to undo if they are stuck

check they are stuck. DONE

* TODO send error report to wasm4 github issue tracker

linker script flag --strip-all causes wasm-validator error. strip-all removes symbols in object file? it's kind of esoteric i couldn't find much info online. but i didn't look that hard

LDFLAGS += -Wl,--strip-all,--gc-sections,--lto-O3 -Oz

--export-all makes it work

** TODO make a reproducible program?
i could use the snakery project itself?

i could do a simple template project and test it.
